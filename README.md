CompositeXibView
================

**Inspired by https://github.com/PaulSolt/CompositeXib**

Lets you build complex interfaces and layouts by composing smaller interfaces together. Supports autolayout.

CompositeXibView serves as a base-class that implements `initWithCoder:` for you, so that it's not necessary to repeat the steps for every view you want to compose together.
